# Getting Started

Running this program:

`$ rustc main.rs`
`$ ./main`
`Hello, world!`

## Notes

- Functions and Macros are different by using `!` to call a macro
- Compiling and running are different steps
- You can compile programs with `rustc` but if you use dependencies you need `cargo`
- Majority of Rust programs use Rust
